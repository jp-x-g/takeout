This is a very simple app that does everything in the spec, and a few additional things. Time constraints left some obvious lacunae and shortcomings (this is **not** an app that it's secure or reasonable to have people use in production).

To use this, and to first prepare it by filling it with dummy data:

rm data/db.sqlite
DEBUG=myapp:* npm start

Structure
The frontend of this app was written using a combination of CSS and HTML, with pages generated using the Jade/Pug templating engine.

The backend is written in Express; it communicates downward with the database (implemented using SQLite) and upwards with the Jade templates to serve data to users in response to queries.
// "express", "pug", "sqlite" etc should be linked
The flow of interacting with the software consists of two main "dashboard" pages, one for students and one for coaches, that can both be reached from the landing page of the app. Features are as follows:

Coaches
Past sessions (lists times, student names, scores, and notes)
Upcoming sessions (including booked and open, which are shown in different colors
- Phone numbers are given for students who have booked sessions.
Pending sessions (those which have elapsed, but have not been given assessments yet)
- This section includes a form where coaches can give ratings and notes, and submit them to the database.
Dialog to create an open session
- This includes a date and time picking dialog that uses a calendar

Students
Past sessions (lists times, coach names, scores, and notes)
Upcoming sessions
- Phone numbers are given for coaches who have booked sessions.
Pending sessions
- There are no interactive elements here, but it provides information on which sessions have taken place (rather than having them drop into a black hole between the time they elapse and the time they're available in the past-sessions record)
Dialog to book session
- This shows all sessions that occur in the future and are open to be booked. Students can book one session at a time (using radio buttons) -- there is no limit to how many they can book total.

Structure
All queries are sent to the Express server by form submissions and are parsed through routes. The main two routes (students and coaches) handle queries for selecting a student/coach to log in as, viewing past/upcoming sessions, and booking/assessing sessions. These queries are passed to the routes with URL parameters (i.e. /coaches?coachid=3&action=add&newslotTime=2024-04-22T06%3A12).

The database consists of three tables: students, coaches, and slots. More in-depth information can be found in the database schemae themselves, but in short, it is in third normal form. This means that there is no duplicated information; changing a student's phone number or a coach's name only requires a single entry to be updated. Non-key attributes depend only on the primary key of their respective tables. The drawback of this approach is that getting basic information out of the database requires complicated JOIN statements; the benefit comes from improved performance, elimination of redundancy, and the ability to segregate data (note, for instance, that students' phone numbers are not retrieved from the database unless necessary).

Lacunae
There are many shortcomings of this app that make it unsuitable for production use in its current state. Some of these are extremely obvious, and others are less so. The architecture of the app was set up so that most of them could be easily fixed without needing major changes to its core structure.

- Authentication and security
This is blindingly obvious: you log in as a user by selecting their name from a dropdown menu. However, there are also many insecure features that are less apparent: when you submit a form, the Express routes don't validate who you're submitting it as. That is to say, you could log in as Plato (coachid=3) and add sessions for Aristotle by changing the URL param to coachid=4.

While there is some validation and sanitization of input fields, it has not been rigorously tested, so it is likely that an attacker could cajole the server into behaving strangely, or a normal user could accidentally make it do weird things. There is also the problem that queries are passed as plaintext in URL parameters. There is not a good reason for this, I just didn't have time to do it a better way.

The database is structured in such a way that student and coach phone numbers are kept isolated from the table with all the appointments in it, and the database is queried and parsed in the backend (i.e. clients are not sent all phone numbers, only the ones they have access to). However, the SQL query outputs that get sent to the templating engine *do* have every student phone number in them, for example -- so would it be possible to futz around with this app and make it display an error message that told you other people's phone numbers? I don't know. I would want to find out a lot more about that before I deployed this.

In general, I didn't get the chance to exhaustively debug this, so there is almost certainly some sequence (or many sequences) of inputs that will cause it to break for no apparent reason.

- Efficiency
As far as login methods go, "every student's name in a big dropdown menu" is probably among the worst. It is used here only because the app is written to work with a small set of test data. In reality, we would use some other authentication method.

Moreover, the dashboards simply showing every single past session (or every single session open for booking) is not scalable; presumably people would end up having hundreds or thousands of them. This would be better addressed by having some means to select a range, search, or otherwise apply filters, which would then be done in a separate operation from loading the main dashboard.

- Time zone bugs
This is pretty obvious: it doesn't account for them at all. This works fine during a demo session, but in any real situation it would be utter chaos (to say nothing of Daylight Savings Time). The way to solve this would be to store all dates as UTC and then display them differently based on user locale (which *could be* read out of a browser, but in reality, it is far better to just get offsets from a user's account on the website).

- Error checking
It does require you to add sessions in the future, and a coach cannot create two sessions starting at the same time, but there is nothing beyond that. There's really no sanity checking or overlap prevention. You can add sessions in the year 3024; a coach can add sixty sessions starting on each minute of the same hour; a student can book themselves for twenty simultaneous sessions with different coaches. It's bonkers. There is a very obvious way to check and prevent this -- when creating or booking a session, do one test to see if there's an existing session that starts less than two hours before it, and a second test to see if there's an existing session that starts less than two hours after it. There's even a place in the code where these tests would go, they just didn't, because of time constraints. 

- Ability to cancel sessions, mark as absent, et cetera
There are several statuses it's possible for a session to have -- open, booked, booked-and-not-assessed, assessed. But there are also many more possibilities: a coach can cancel, a student can cancel, a student can no-show, some bizarre problem can cause one of the participants to be completely unable to see video during the whole call, et cetera. It should be possible, both for users to cancel booked sessions from the dashboard, and also for coaches to mark sessions as having different statuses in the "writeup" prompt area.

- No takebacks?
The spec didn't say anything about being able to cancel, alter, remove or reverse any of the things you do in this app -- and I didn't have a lot of time to write it. This would be an obvious improvement: currently, the app is outrageously user-hostile, as everything you type into it or click on is permanent (barring a database wipe).

Also, if you type something into any of the fields, that means it gets sent when you submit the form even if you delete it later. JavaScript could fix this.

- Page loads
I wrote this with Express and used static pages for the frontend because of time constraints and a large feature set that didn't leave a lot of room for fancy stuff. But ideally, there'd be something which allowed you to take actions without requiring page reloads.

- User experience
The user experience of this app, from simply implementing what the spec said, leaves a great deal to be desired. Probably the most obvious things are:

-- Calendars versus text datestamps
It is somewhat difficult to distinguish dates from looking at them, versus having a calendar widget (especially when trying to book sessions). This would be an improvement.
-- Data entry as timewaster for coaches
Adding an availablility requires coaches to open the dashboard and manually select the slot using the date picker, then click to add it, then wait for the page to reload. This isn't that hard to do once or twice, but if a coach works every weekday, and has several available slots, adding them will be a daily task. If this takes six minutes a day, that's thirty minutes a week, which is two hours a month; with ten coaches this is twenty hours a month, every month, of people's time being wasted on pointless busywork. There should be an option for them to articulate to the computer, for example, "I am available every Tuesday at 10am".
-- URL parameters
Passing text fields (especially notes) into the app through URL parameters is just bad: it turns URLs into giant monsters that can't be used for anything (and might contain confidential information). It also means that refreshing the page, in most cases, will resend whatever action you were trying to take. This is bad.
-- Error messages
They aren't very good. Not much more to say about that.

-- Accessibility
I didn't have the chance to extensively test this for accessibility. There is Unicode support in SQLite (i.e. students and instructors can have names in arbitrary non-Latin scripts, which is good) but I don't know what will happen if you try to use RTL encodings, or one of the more complicated scripts with a bunch of combining characters etc.

The form to create a new session uses the HTML input type "datetime-local", which MDN said is not fully supported by all browsers, and their fallback rendering is to a normal date picker (with no time) -- ideally the app would have some way of detecting this and providing an alternate selection method -- perhaps properly bounded "number" inputs for the time, perhaps some very fancy thing that loads a bunch of frameworks.

-- Various details
Some of the visual elements on the page have formatting that's slightly off in a way that bugs me, which I won't point out because as soon as you notice it, it will start to bug you too, and you won't be able to notice anything else.
